# Change password
  User Password Change Form using React and MaterialUI (TextField, Snackbar, Alert)

The application uses validation of all required fields.
Validates:<br>
    - empty required field<br>
    - mismatch of the current and new password<br>
    - match the new password and repeat the new password<br>
    - validation of backend responses is also provided<br>

For validation errors, the field is highlighted in red and a warning message is displayed.<br>
It is also possible to change the type of header depending on the display of the password change page or the main page.
